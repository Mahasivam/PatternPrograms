How to print star programs easily!
Just follow the steps
The outer loop “i” is responsible for no. of rows, and the inner loop is responsible for columns, also note the inner loop is the loop that actually prints the stars.

Step1: Find how many triangles needs to be printed
Step2: For increasing triangle – the inner loop condition will be j<=i and For decreasing triangle – the inner loop intialization will be j=i
Note:

Learn how to figure out how many triangles are present, otherwise, it will seem to be complex lol
